# Groups Manager — Frame

## Source

> I want to create a portfolio project. A groups manager, where a person logins easily and has a portfolio, with their name, email, title, organization and list of groups they are apart of. You can search for people and/or groups. And in theory being apart of a group gives you access to that group's tools and news, but in the portfolio that functionality is not there. However each group has a name, description, one or more admins, a setting that allows either admins to add people, or anyone to add other people. Admins can remove people, as well as individuals can remove themself, no matter the setting. Admins can also make other people admins or demote other admins to members. There is a change history of what changed, when and who made the change. There is also a completely who feature/product called Automatic Membership, which allows admins to set automation rules to add people to the group based upon whether they match the filter(s), like title, organization and email. E.g., [title] [is] [engineer]. These filters can be anded or or'd together. Parenthesis or deep nesting would be nice, but not necessary. When viewing a group there is a preview of whether Automatic Membership is set. And the portfolio should be pre-filled with people at the company. Maybe a dozen or so. And groups that make sense, like R&D, Engineers, Recruiting.

## Problem

A portfolio project needs a real, non-trivial feature set to demonstrate full-stack capability. A groups management system — with role-based membership controls, audit history, and rule-driven automatic membership — has enough depth to showcase data modeling, access control logic, and UX design without requiring actual integrations.

## Outcome

A working, demo-ready web app where:
- Visitors can log in and see their person profile
- People and groups are searchable
- Groups have configurable membership rules and admin controls
- A complete change history shows all group activity
- Automatic membership rules can be defined and previewed
- The app comes pre-loaded with realistic seed data (people + groups)
